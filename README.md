## Hanifrev's React Boilerplate

Basicaly this is my own ReactJS boilerplate
(and it will updated later depends on my needs). There is a reason why I'm using my own boilerplate (build from scratch) to setup my React project rather than using CRA, it's because I can't fully customize the Webpack in CRA. But in some cases, I'm still use CRA.

I'm using Webpack for bundler, Babel for transpiler
